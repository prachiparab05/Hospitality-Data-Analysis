# Python-Hospitality-Data-Analysis-Project

## Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands, a prominent hotel chain in India, is facing challenges due to increasing competition from rival hotels, resulting in declining revenue. To address this issue, the management has decided to leverage data-driven insights for strategic decision-making. Lacking in-house expertise, they have sought external professionals to analyze the problem, derive actionable insights, and propose effective strategies to retain customers and boost revenue.

## Project Goal
The primary objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the hotel business domain using Python. By extracting valuable insights from data, actionable recommendations will be provided to AtliQ Grands, enabling them to make informed decisions and regain their competitive edge in the market.

## Project Highlights
1. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.
2. **Data Transformation**: Introduced additional columns, such as occupancy percentage (%), to enhance the dataset.
3. **Insights Generation**: Answered key business questions, including:
    - Calculating the average occupancy rate by room type and city.
    - Identifying occupancy rates for weekdays versus weekends.
    - Analyzing June occupancy rates across different cities.
    - Assessing revenue generated per city.
    - Evaluating monthly revenue trends.
    - Investigating revenue trends by hotel type.
    - Determining average customer ratings per city.
    - Examining revenue contributions by booking platforms.

## Skills and Tools Utilized
- **Python Programming**: Advanced skills in Python for data analysis, cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilized Matplotlib to create compelling charts and visualizations.
- **Pandas Library**: Expertise in creating and manipulating DataFrames, using groupby functions, concatenating and merging datasets, handling missing values, and reading/writing CSV files.
